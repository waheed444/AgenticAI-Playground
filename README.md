- Python 3.7+ installed locally (if not using Colab).
- Git for cloning the repository.

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic familiarity with **Python** programming.
- Understanding of core **AI/ML concepts** (e.g., neural networks, supervised/unsupervised learning).
- Optional: Familiarity with Generative AI (e.g., GANs, transformers) or Agentic AI (e.g., reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems).

### Recommended Libraries
Install the following libraries to run the notebooks locally:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pytorch transformers numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

For specific project dependencies, refer to the `requirements.txt` file or individual notebook instructions.
